									<p id="nurj2">The Northwestern Undergraduate Research Journal (NURJ) is an annual student-produced journal that showcases outstanding research done by Northwestern undergraduates from across all academic fields. As the only peer-and faculty- reviewed journal of undergraduate research at Northwestern University, our goal is to make research more accessible, showcase outstanding work, and to use our online publications as a means of expanding upon what is offered by our print format.

										<h3>Concept</h3>
										<p>Increase <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">accessibility</span></span> of research on campus by shedding light on the experience of completing an 
											independent undergraduate research project by featuring recipients of Northwestern's Summer Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG).
											
											<br><br>Use a unique format that capitalizes on the online format and differentiates the online publication from the print publication.

											<!--
											<br><br>I co-interviewed 5 researchers about their experiences and edited 4 hours of 
											video footage on Final Cut Pro X to create a 40 minute feature. 
		
											Each video segment covers interviewee responses to questions aimed at a specific aspect of the research 
											process, preceding a write-up highlighting this aspect of one interviewee's project experience. I recruited and 
											trained 5 students in AP style, coordinating timelines and delegating edits to accomplish this.

									<h3>Process</h3>
									<h4>(1) Soliciting, selecting, planning</h4>
										<div class="small_container">
											<section style="width: 50%">
												<p>Prior to outreach, I <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">drafted a one-pager</span></span> describing the project in full and outlining requirements for applicants. I provided materials 
												to our web development team for online solicitation & coordinated with our outreach team to identify key departmental targets, professors,
												and groups to help publicize the opportunity.
												<br><br>
												I <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">reviewed all submissions and research theses</span></span> submitted, selecting five that stood out as impressive and that complemented one another well,
												spanning different disciplines and conducted in various settings.

												</p>
											</section>
											
										</div>
										
									<h4>(2) Interviewing</h4>
										<div class="small_container">
											<section style="width: 48%">
												<p>After landing on five umbrella categories, we drafted interview questions for each. All prior NURJ publications were formal
												in their presentation, and we were careful in crafting humorous and surprising questions to confront interviewee expectations
												and set the stage for authentic descriptions of their experiences.</p>
												<p>I co-interviewed five recipients using rented AV equipment in my living room with Managing Director of Development Kevin Bai.

									<h4>(3) Mixed-format storybuilding & Writeups</h4>
										<div class="small_container">
											<section style="width: 48%">
												<p>Each video segment covered interviewee responses to questions aimed at a specific aspect of the research 
													process, preceding a write-up highlighting this aspect of one interviewee's project experience. 
													I created team storyboarding exercises to engage newly onboarded staff in collaborative brainstorming,
													ultimately deciding on this format, shown at right. 
												</p>
												<p>
													I <span class="highlight-container"><span class="higlight">recruited and trained</span></span> 5 new team members in AP style, coordinating timelines and 
													delegating edits. Creating consistency across written segments proved a major obstacle, particularly with an <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">unprecedented publication format</span></span>.
													I noticed that more guidance was needed after sharing interviewee Katerina Stanisavljevic's written feature as a template,
													so I created a feature writeup skeleton. <!-- selecting a standout quote from each interviewee pertaining
													to the section topic and setting an optional outline to provide guidance. -->After initial drafts & content editing
													on my part, three rounds of peer-editing were assigned. The final product was reviewed by myself and 
													Associate Managing Editors Defne Deda & Alanna Liu.

												<p>Major unexpected obstacles emerged as <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">video & audio post-production</span></span> began: </p>
												<ul style="font-size: smaller";>
													<li>An <u>understaffed development team</u>. </li>

													<li>An <u>unattainable collaborative workflow</u> without professional and expensive video production tools to allow third-party cloud transfers of massive files.</li>
													<li><u>Poor audio and video quality</u> despite positive results from initial testing. 
														Inconsistent volume, white noise, areas of mono rather than stereo audio and other pain points necessitated a crash course in Final Cut Pro X 
														software tools.</li>

											<section style="width: 48%">
												<p>I had to strategically <span class="highlight-container"><span class="higlight">balance technical work & team management</span></span> by remaining adaptable:
												</p>
												<ul style="font-size: smaller">
													<li>To <u>oversee key narrative choices</u>, I took on footage from three interviewees, later 
														editing audio/video on the other two (edited by Kevin Bai) for consistency & sorting them by question response. 
													</li>
													<li>To ensure ample time for <u>quality content creation without stalling staff</u>, I pushed back our publication timeline by a month and 
														and opted to present one interviewee's uncut interview to each staff member to get drafting of writeups underway. With high quality interviewee responses, we quadrupled the planned duration of video content to 40 minutes.</li>

									<h4>(5) Publishing</h4>
