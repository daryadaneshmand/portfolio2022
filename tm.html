										<h3>Project Description</h3>
										<p>
											Knight Lab Studio is a by-application course through which cross-disciplinary teams collaborate to 
											create cutting-edge digital work, combining research, design thinking, and analytical methods.
										</p>
										<p>
											Over 10 weeks, the 10-person AI Art Generation project team will work to produce and build upon a method for turning an article 
											into a stable diffusion text prompt, returning AI generated art recommendations 
											to go with the article.
										</p>
										<h3>Role</h3>
										<p>
											My focus within this project is on retraining the current model while collaborating and sharing findings
											with teamates focusing on social media experimentation and automation. Our training goals includes correcting for key issues
											including Western and racial biases and copyright.

								<section style="width: 33%">
									<h3>Purpose</h3>
									<p>Convey the impact of word choice on perceptions of people with addictions.</p>
							
								</section>
								<section style="width: 33%">
									<h3>Process</h3>
									<p>This journal's use of categories and the statistical significance of their respective dependent sample t-tests guided my selection of this data, after having combed through 50+ articles of the same topics. Iterations based on other data were ultimately discarded due to the difficulty of simultaneously retaining objectivity and ommitting information that created visual noise.  </p>
								</section>
								<section style="width: 33%">
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>This visualization was published as a part of an article I wrote on the impact of stigma. Treatment Magazine's editor-in-chief praised the article as the best of many pieces run on stigma,
										in large part due to this approach toward representing harm.

								<section style="width: 31%">
									<h3>Purpose</h3>
									<p>Convey implicit word associations through data comparing labels with negative vs. positive implications.</p>
							
								</section>
								<section style="width: 31%">
									<h3>Process</h3>
									<p> After refining the relevant data, I created an initial graph by inputting my edited CSV into RAWgraphs and choosing the above grouping format.
										I transfered the SVG output to Adobe Illustrator to make a few edits, and used the ai2html script to use
										the html output to add a layer of interactivity. 
										<br> <br> </p>
								</section>
								<section style="width: 31%">
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p> An immediate indication of which word within each two-word pair is the negative word (NW) or positive word (PW) stood out as an association
										in need of visual support. I intend to re-create this visualization, but opted for a descriptive reference within the article:
									</p>
									
									<blockquote style="font-size: 0.65em">
										<p><em>...Such findings are corroborated by an analysis of implicit biases elicited by different addiction terminology. In a 2018 study on substance use, recovery and linguistics, participants performed an association test, with results finding that the strongest associations were those between terms such as “opioid abuser,” “alcoholic” and “addict”—negative words, according to the hypothesis—and bad. In comparison, hypothesized positive terms such as “opioid use disorder” and “alcohol use disorder” were associated either more with good or significantly less with bad, even if they retained their negative association. Essentially, participants’ immediate perception improved across all four areas of comparison when using terms aligned with the disease model of addiction. </em></p>

									</blockquote>
									<p>This inter-software workflow informed my understanding of how proportional scaling
										can be accomplished with different tools.</p>
