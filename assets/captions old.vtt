00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.833
<font color="#ffffff">I think any creative process,  whether you're a screenwriter,</font>

2
00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.268
<font color="#ffffff">an artist, a painter, or</font>

3
00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:06.636
<font color="#ffffff">you know, writing poetry or  anything</font>

4
00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:10.073
<font color="#ffffff">I mean I think this can  transcend all disciplines</font>

5
00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:12.075
<font color="#ffffff">It's very interdisciplinary in  that way.</font>

6
00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:15.078
<font color="#ffffff">But I think that creative  process is something that allows</font>

7
00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:18.548
<font color="#ffffff">you to kind of access something  deeper within yourself</font>

8
00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.751
<font color="#ffffff">to bring forward your own  insight.</font>

9
00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.352
<font color="#ffffff">So it's like you're  researching your own mind.</font>

10
00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.354
<font color="#ffffff">Well I think any academic will  tell you this</font>

11
00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:26.857
<font color="#ffffff">but the transition from reading  to writing</font>

12
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.192
<font color="#ffffff">it isn't so much an obstacle</font>

13
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.361
<font color="#ffffff">so much as it is part of the  process</font>

14
00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:34.965
<font color="#ffffff">Writing is just hard, you know</font>

15
00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.099
<font color="#ffffff">Reading is really fun</font>

16
00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:38.602
<font color="#ffffff">Getting paid to read is an  incredible experience</font>

17
00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:40.771
<font color="#ffffff">and made me want to do grad  school</font>

18
00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:42.939
<font color="#ffffff">And I am someone who's like</font>

19
00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:46.376
<font color="#ffffff">kind of considering grad school, and, you know, academia</font>

20
00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.445
<font color="#ffffff">This did help me solidify that.</font>

21
00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.180
<font color="#ffffff">I don't know if it made me sure</font>

22
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.182
<font color="#ffffff">that I want to go into that, but</font>

23
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.851
<font color="#ffffff">you know...</font>

24
00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.321
<font color="#ffffff">There's so much culture at  Northwestern too</font>

25
00:50:58.321 --> 00:51:00.724
<font color="#ffffff">where it's like 'I am constantly doing things'</font>

26
00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:03.093
<font color="#ffffff">and I feel like I've made it a  priority for myself now</font>

27
00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:05.128
<font color="#ffffff">to like, actually step back and  be like,</font>

28
00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:06.696
<font color="#ffffff">'What do I want to be doing  right now?'</font>

29
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.832
<font color="#ffffff">Cool, yeah, this was great.</font>

30
00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:10.867
<font color="#ffffff">I did this last time too</font>

31
00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:12.068
<font color="#ffffff">Don't break the camera</font>
