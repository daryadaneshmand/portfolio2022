							<h2>Hi, I'm Darya</h2>
							<p>I'm a third-year student at Northwestern University studying <span style="color: #86b3d3">Neuroscience</span> and <span style="color: #86b3d3">Journalism</span> and pursuing the <span style="color: #86b3d3">Segal Design Certificate</span>. I take initiative where I see opportunity spaces, and take an <span style="color: #86b3d3">interdisciplinary approach</span>
								to problem solving.<br><br>I find that scientists are designers by definition, harnessing the power of observation to understand systems and their relationships. By researching our environments and selves, we learn how to improve them, redesigning our lives and minds.
								<br><br> Observing (researching) people and the spaces they inhabit sparks my creative drive. My ability to <span style="color: #86b3d3;">adapt</span> and my comfort with approaching <span style="color: #86b3d3;">unfamiliar territory</span> are to me my most valuable soft skills. In the workplace, I value <span style="color: #86b3d3">communication, adaptability, and transparency</span>, and bring my initiative and drive to every endeavor I take on.
								<br><br> Work aside, I love spending time outdoors and on the move. I do a lot of hiking at home in San Diego, am a Padi Certified diver, and have an M1 license certification (and a Yamaha R3). Indoors, you'd likely find me reading my latest find in non-fiction or philosophical fiction, drawing, <span style="color: #86b3d3">playing chess</span> or watching a Hikaru stream, or working on a <span style="color: #86b3d3">passion project</span>. My family jokes that <span style="color: #86b3d3">live music</span> has always been a higher budgetary priority for me than groceries, and that fact I cannot refute.

							<h2 style="color:#f5926e">Scientist</h2>
							<p class="description">Research on psychiatric disorders such as depression, mood disorders, and substance use disorders are of great interest to me, particularly as 
								they pertain to behavioral states such as sleep and attention. My interest in sensory processing stems from my interest in auditory processing 
								of music, on which I have taken a course and read several books. I enjoy learning about the biological foundations of memory consolidation, and 
								my interest in contexts for abstract learning stems from my love of chess and the role it has played in improving my own memory over the course 
								of the past two years. 
							
								While previously shadowing and subsequently assisting with neurofeedback sessions, I had a chance to review EEG results of patients with various 
								psychiatric conditions and traumatic brain injuries. Seeing changes in the expression of different brain waves in specific brain regions over 
								courses of treatment (by examining archives) furthered an existing interest in both non-invasive neuromodulation and transcranial brain stimulation.

							<h2 style="color:#f5926e">Engineer</h2>
							<p class="description">I began working at the Segal Prototyping and Fabrication Lab at Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center serendipitously. Upon entering the 
								shop to complete a training, I was the last to finish the miniature house each trainee built because I was longingly staring at the machines we <em>weren't</em> using.
								When they mentioned that they were in need of trainers, I figured it couldn't hurt to apply. I love working with my hands and experimenting with novel media. I enjoy 
								laser cutting and engraving wood pieces for my apartment, making rings on the lathe, and honing my skills on the mill. Going forward, I hope to gain proficiency on 
								the CNC milling machine and welding, for which I have received introductory training. I'd like to practice more with CAD software, as I have beginner level experience
								with Solidworks.

							<h2 style="color:#f5926e">Designer</h2>
							<p class="description">I hope to design solutions that improve spaces and experiences by drawing from my different knowledge bases and collaborating with like-minded people. Mother earth is the ultimate designer; thus, biomimicry is my favorite form of design. I enjoy studying my environment, and hope to 
								someday apply my design skills to areas for sustainabile innovation such as biosynthesis and architecture.

							<h2 style="color:#f5926e">Artist</h2>
							<p class="description">I dabble in art across several forms of media. I enjoy sketching with mechanical pencil and create digital art primarily with  Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate. My focus within my Journalism major has primarily been on interactive media.  I'm a big fan of creative coding for music visualizers and am also drawn to creative data visualization. Frederica Fragapane is an inspiration of mine (I learned a lot from her Skillshare course). Above all, I am drawn to interactive installation art.
