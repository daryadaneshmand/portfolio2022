								<h3><a href="https://treatmentmagazine.com/chess-as-therapy/">CHESS AS THERAPY</a></h3>
								<p><em>Treatment Magazine</em><br>October 12, 2021</p>
								<p id="chessdescription">Inspired by my interest in the impact 
								of chess on brain development and the interaction 
								between one's psychology and game play. <br> <br>It is well
								established that chess offers therapeutic benefits
								for those struggling with their mental health, but not
								as much research has been done on chess and addiction.
								
								The article pulls from an array of scientific research 
								over the years on chess and the brain, along with
								personal stories and instances in which this phenomenon
								was successfully harnessed for good. </p>

								<p><em>Treatment Magazine</em><br>October 12, 2021</p>
								<p id="qadescription">When I found chess teacher Hugh Patterson's work as 
								columnist for GM Nigel Davies's column “The Chess 
								Improver,” I knew I had to talk to him.
								
								His powerful story of recovery and
								as an instructor for people from all walks of life — from
								 kids in Juvenile Hall to people at Narcotics Anonymous — had to stand alone, told in his own words.</p>

								<p><em>To be published</em><br> 2022</p>
								<p id="RETdescription"> A long-form piece highlighting the work of The Tree Lab,
									a group on campus tackling the intersection of race, ethics, and technology.
									
									Supplemental commentary pulls from novels and journals that delve into specific topics explored
									by their work. I interviewed the group's co-founders and several team members
									to explore how their work in TREE Lab has set the stage for future work in this field.

								<p><em>Treatment Magazine</em><br>December 1, 2021</p>
								<p id="stigmadescription">Exploring how stigma on every level — structural, public, and self-stigma — harms those with substance use disorders (SUDs). </p>
								<p>I took an opportunity to apply data journalism in a space where it is often absent, largely due to the prevalence of 
									qualitative over quantitative data. I had previously only worked with large refinable datasets, and appreciated the challenge
									of interpreting experimental findings.</p>

								<p>HumanID is a non-profit and open source project started
