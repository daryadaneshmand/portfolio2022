00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.144
I think any creative process,  whether you're a screenwriter,

2
00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.580
an artist, a painter, or

3
00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.948
you know, writing poetry or  anything

4
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.385
I mean I think this can  transcend all disciplines

5
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.387
It's very interdisciplinary in  that way.

6
00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.390
But I think that creative  process is something that allows

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.860
you to kind of access something  deeper within yourself

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.062
to bring forward your own  insight.

9
00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.663
So it's like you're  researching your own mind.

10
00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.665
Well I think any academic will  tell you this

11
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.168
but the transition from reading  to writing

12
00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.504
it isn't so much an obstacle

13
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.672
so much as it is part of the  process

14
00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.276
Writing is just hard, you know

15
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.411
Reading is really fun

16
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.913
Getting paid to read is an  incredible experience

17
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.082
and made me want to do grad  school

18
00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.251
And I am someone who's like

19
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.687
kind of considering grad school, and, you know, academia

20
00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.756
This did help me solidify that.

21
00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.491
I don't know if it made me sure

22
00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.493
that I want to go into that, but

23
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.163
you know...

24
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.633
There's so much culture at  Northwestern too

25
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.035
where it's like 'I am constantly doing things'

26
00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.404
and I feel like I've made it a  priority for myself now

27
00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.440
to like, actually step back and  be like,

28
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.008
'What do I want to be doing  right now?'

29
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.143
Cool, yeah, this was great.

30
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.179
I did this last time too

31
00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.380
Don't break the camera
