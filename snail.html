									<p>In my DSGN 384 Interdisciplinary Product Design course, I worked in a team of four on a client-based project
										for two quarters.
									</p>
									<p id="nurj2">Our client, Shedd Aquarium researcher Dr. Andy Kough, studies conch movement. My three teammates and I set out to design a snail tracking device that (1) accurately and efficiently translated accelerometer data to directionality, (2) securely attached the device to the conch, (3) prevented internal movement, and (4) increased energy efficiency.

							<div class="container">
								<section style="width: 48%">
									<h4>Literature Review</h4>
									<p>Following initial client communication and identification of client & user needs, I compiled external research with my team into a spreadsheet with several key categories: Attachments, Accelerometers, Snails, Sustainability, & Other. <br> <br> 
									
									Our most relevant findings were included in a <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight"></span>14-page literature review</span></span>. Client research goals 
									and current study design were introduced, followed by outlining of relevant prior research and takeaways 
									from other research projects tracking marine life. I primarily focused on waterproofing and on comparing alternative study designs.</p>
								</section>
								<section style="width: 48%">
									<h4>Expert Sources</h4>
									<p>I connected with NOAA researcher Jennifer Doerr to learn about her team's conch tracking methodology, which informed initial directions in
										 <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">testing epoxy resins</span></span> as an alternative attachment method, and later connected with Materials Science and Engineering Professor Emeritus Stephen Carr to 
										 better understand physical properties of such adhesives. 
										 <br><br>
										 After team discussions with Mechanical Engineering Professor Nick Marchuk about <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">circuits and energy capacity</span></span>,
										 I researched inertial measurement units (IMUs) and alternate arduino configurations, which were included as possible future directions in product report appendices.

											<span style="font-size:smaller">Accelerometer axes do not align with the heading of the conchs, primarily due to slight

							<h3>MIAMI FIELD WORK</h3>
							<div class="container">
								<section style="width:72%">
									<p>Teammate Bryan Sanchez and I received a grant to perform observation and testing of the full user process in Miami.
									We began by soldering data loggers and placing them in their Go-Pro housing along with the other components. I joined our client and his partner in freediving to retrieve 
									16 conchs in Port Everglades. (They all look like rocks from the surface, but I managed to pull up three from the seafloor.) After placing the conchs in a saltwater 
									mesocosm at Florida International University Biscayne Campus, we attached the trackers and <span class="highlight-container"><span class="highlight">tested data logger functionality</span></span>. A novel alignment method was tested, and data
									was recorded in order to correct movement data after the testing period.
